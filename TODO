## Harmonic Analysis
- return result of the harmonic figureheads in the data (music) given.
- the harmonic figureheads such as the key, the progression, the main chords, and the main scales. 
- the harmonic figureheads are the main elements that define the harmonic structure of a piece of music.
  
## Melodic Analysis
- return result of the melodic intervals in the data.
- the melodic intervals are the main elements that define the melodic structure of a piece of music, e.g. going up a fifth then back down the scale (as a simple melody)
  
## Voicing 
- voice chords to that each note is played in a different 8ve (or same depending on structure) and to make sure each note travels the least distance to get to the next chord.
- this is a common technique in music theory to make the music sound more pleasing to the ear and connected.

## Generation via Tonal Center
- generate a voiced chord progression based on a "home-base" note.
- this does not have to be the root note of the scale/chord progression, but can be any note in the scale.
- the generated progression will be voiced in a way which makes the overall flow of the music sound more connected and gives it a place to return to without fully resolving.
